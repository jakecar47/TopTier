### Project Description:

TopTier is a full-stack, website development project designed to 'localize' video game competition. The central idea is to allow users to compare their gaming skills with others in their community or around the world. Website users can view the leaderboards for any selected game, and login or create an account to add their own scores. TopTier then ranks them amongst all the highscores posted to the game, updating the leaderboards with their own scores.
